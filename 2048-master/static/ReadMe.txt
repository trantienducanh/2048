- walk over the array from the first to the last number
  - for each original number in the array that is not zero
    - look backwards for a target position that does not contain a zero (unless it is position zero)
      - if the target position does not contain the original number use the next position
    - if the target position is different from the original position
      - add the number to the number on the target position
      - replace the original number by zero
